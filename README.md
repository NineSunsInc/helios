Helios is an open source protocol that provides AI systems with toolkits to handle private data and personally identifiable information (PII). The protocol emphasizes transparency, data ownership, and consistency. Currently in its infancy, a request for comments [RFC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Yv9MgFm6V5OBDdjRn3vJKUIm_xlGMf66dgMB3Lyl-Q/edit?usp=sharing) is in development. Please review and comment on the RFC via the link. We welcome your input on this project in its early stages!

If you have any questions, please reacch out. @masterfung is the maintainer
